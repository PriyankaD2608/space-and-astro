            <h2>Explore more about Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth from the Sun. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. One of its most distinctive features is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has a powerful magnetic field and the strongest gravity of any planet in the solar system. It also has at least 95 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, and Europa, which is believed to have a subsurface ocean that could harbor life. Jupiter's fast rotation, completing a day in just 10 hours, causes strong atmospheric bands and violent storms. The planet plays a crucial role in the solar system by deflecting asteroids and comets with its immense gravity, protecting the inner planets, including Earth. Several space missions, including NASA’s Juno, have been sent to study Jupiter’s atmosphere, composition, and mysterious interior.</p>
