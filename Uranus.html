            <h2>Explore more about Uranus</h2>
<p>The seventh planet from the Sun is Uranus, an ice giant known for its unique tilted rotation. Unlike any other planet in the solar system, Uranus rotates on its side with a tilt of about 98 degrees, likely due to a massive collision in the past. This unusual tilt causes extreme seasonal changes, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.

    Uranus has a pale blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. It has 13 faint rings and 27 known moons, many of which are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The planet's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, with the coldest temperatures in the solar system, reaching as low as -224°C (-371°F).
    
    The only spacecraft to visit Uranus was Voyager 2 in 1986, which provided valuable data about its atmosphere, rings, and moons. Due to its distance and mysterious nature, Uranus is a target for future space missions to better understand its composition and history.</p>
