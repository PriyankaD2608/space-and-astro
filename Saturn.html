            <h2>Explore more about Saturn</h2>
<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, best known for its stunning ring system made of ice, rock, and dust. It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a low density—so low that it could float in water if a large enough body of water existed. Saturn has a fast rotation, completing a day in just 10.7 hours, which causes its shape to be slightly flattened at the poles. The planet has at least 146 known moons, including Titan, the largest, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane and ethane, making it a key target for future exploration. Saturn’s strong winds and storms, including a persistent hexagonal storm at its north pole, add to its unique characteristics. NASA’s Cassini spacecraft provided valuable insights into Saturn and its rings before ending its mission in 2017 by diving into the planet’s atmosphere.</p>        </main>
