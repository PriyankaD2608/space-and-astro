            <h2>Explore more about Pluto
<p>Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Once considered the ninth planet of the solar system, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to its inability to clear its orbit of other debris. Despite its small size, Pluto has a complex and dynamic surface, with glaciers, mountains made of water ice, and a thin atmosphere that expands and contracts as it orbits the Sun.

    Pluto has five known moons, the largest being Charon, which is so big relative to Pluto that they are sometimes considered a binary system. Pluto’s orbit is highly elliptical, causing it to sometimes come closer to the Sun than Neptune. A day on Pluto lasts about 153 hours, and a full orbit around the Sun takes 248 Earth years.
    
    NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, providing detailed images and revealing a surprisingly active world with a heart-shaped glacier called Tombaugh Regio. Pluto remains an object of great interest in planetary science, helping scientists understand the outer solar system and the formation of icy worlds.
