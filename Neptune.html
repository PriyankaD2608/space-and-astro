            <h2>Explore more about Neptune</h2>
<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the solar system. It is a gas giant and the only planet not visible to the naked eye, having been discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions. Neptune has a deep blue color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. It experiences the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). The planet also has a massive storm system known as the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiterâ€™s Great Red Spot, though it appears and disappears over time. Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which has geysers that spew nitrogen gas and orbits the planet in the opposite direction of its rotation, suggesting it was a captured object. Due to its extreme distance, Neptune takes 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The Voyager 2 spacecraft, which flew by in 1989, remains the only mission to have visited Neptune, but future missions are being considered to explore this icy giant further.</p>
