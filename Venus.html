            <h2>Explore more about Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s "twin" due to its similar size and composition. However, it has a harsh and extreme environment, making it one of the most inhospitable planets in the solar system. Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a strong greenhouse effect that traps heat. As a result, it has the hottest surface of any planet, with temperatures reaching over 467°C (872°F)—hot enough to melt lead. The planet rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning a day on Venus is longer than a year. Due to its bright and reflective clouds, Venus is one of the most visible objects in the night sky, often referred to as the "Evening Star" or "Morning Star." Despite its extreme conditions, Venus has been a key target for space exploration, with numerous missions studying its atmosphere and surface.</p>
